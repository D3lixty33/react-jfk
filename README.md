# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Update 11/09/2024 11:50

This project is the root project of the website assigned to the domain "jfk.group". 
This page was written in VanillaJS, HTML and CSS, but for better management I updated it to a ReactApp. Before updating it to a ReactApp i started writing this project using NextJS, but the v.v 14.2.3 of this framework doen't compile correctly the webpack.config files so it doesn't work proprely. I noticed this particularity when I tried uploading the video of the page, but it always gave me errors about the URL, or something else. Also in this version of Next, MUX doesn't work either, they are incompatible. 
To resolve this problem I restarted writing the page but I used "create-react-app". Also using this to upload the video I had to load the local video in a function where it gets converted to a blob Url using the func. "URL.createObjectURL" 


Once i resolved this big framework problems I created the components till the slider, now I need to understand if I want to implement a new version of the old slider or I want to replicate the old circular slider.
